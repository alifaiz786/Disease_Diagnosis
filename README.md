# Disease Diagnosis Analysis

This project analyzes a medical dataset containing patient demographics, diagnoses, treatment plans, and physiological measurements. The goal is to uncover trends in disease diagnosis and treatment effectiveness, with a focus on demographic patterns and data-driven insights.

 # Project Objectives

- Explore patterns in diagnosis frequency across gender and age groups  
- Evaluate the distribution of disease severity and treatment choices  
- Clean and preprocess real-world medical data  
- Visualize key patterns to support clinical or healthcare insights

# Files Included

- `Disease_Diagnosis.ipynb` – Complete Jupyter notebook with EDA, preprocessing, and visualizations
- `disease_diagnosis.csv` 

---

# Key Steps in the Analysis

 1. Data Import and Overview
- Imported libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Loaded the dataset and explored shape, missing values, and data types

 2. Data Cleaning
- Standardized text fields (e.g., gender values)
- Removed duplicates
- Converted column types where necessary (e.g., blood pressure readings)

 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of diagnoses across the dataset
- Gender-wise comparison of diagnosis frequencies
- (Further plots include age, severity, and treatment trends)

# Visual Highlights

- Top Diagnosed Conditions – Bar charts showing most frequent diagnoses
- Gender & Diagnosis – Breakdown of diagnosis frequency across male and female patients
- Treatment Mapping – Planned comparison between diagnosis severity and assigned treatment plans

# Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub (Version control & project hosting)

# How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Disease_Diagnosis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Ensure the dataset (`disease_diagnosis.csv`) is in the correct path
4. Run cells sequentially to view outputs
